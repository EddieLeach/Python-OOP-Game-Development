# üõ∏ Alien Invasion

### Summary  
A Python arcade-style space shooter built with **Pygame**.  
This project strengthened my debugging, problem-solving, and GenAI-assisted troubleshooting skills while practicing object-oriented programming and real-time logic.

### üí• What I Made  
- A **fully playable space shooter** with smooth movement, bullet firing, alien waves, and score tracking.  
- **Modular codebase** using classes (`Ship`, `Alien`, `Bullet`, `Game`) to organize logic and gameplay systems.  
- Built a solid foundation in **event-driven programming** and **game loop control**.

---

### ‚öôÔ∏è How I Made It  
- Developed locally in **Python/Pygame**, testing each system through iterative runs and debug prints.  
- Used **Generative AI (ChatGPT & Amazon Q Developer)** to troubleshoot logic bugs, optimize loops, and refactor classes.  
- Managed versions, commits, and fixes through **GitHub**, documenting changes and improvement cycles.  
- Currently packaging for **web deployment** using `pygbag` and planning to host the playable build on **AWS S3**.

---

### üöÄ Why It Matters  
- Demonstrates real-world **debugging** and **GenAI-assisted problem-solving** in an applied project.  
- Shows my ability to **plan, build, test, and iterate** through software issues independently.  
- Highlights practical understanding of **Python fundamentals**, **OOP**, and **deployment workflow**.
